just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , I'm Laura and I'm the project manager .
 Do you want to introduce yourself again ?
 Mm-hmm .

Oh I have to record who's here actually . So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ?
 And you all arrived on time .
 Um yeah so des uh  design a new remote control . Um , as you can see it's
supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it
were . Um and so there are three different stages to the design . Um I'm not really sure what
what you guys have already received um in your emails . What did you get ?
 Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is  . Designing a
remote control . That's about it , didn't get anything else . Did you get the same thing ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's it .
 Is that what everybody got ? Okay . Um . So we're gonna have like individual work and then a
meeting about it . And repeat that process three times . Um and at this point we get try out the
whiteboard over there . Um .  So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum
up your favourite characteristics of it . So who would like to go first ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 I will go . That's fine .
 Very good . 
 Alright . So 
  
 This one here , right ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay . Very nice . Alright . My favourite animal
 is like 
 
 
 A beagle .
 
 Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? Uh , right , well basically um high
priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their
family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . So
this is blue . Blue beagle . My family's beagle .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 
 Right . Lovely . 
 
 [gap]

C: Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .
 
 
 
 Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real ,
 I'm gonna be up there with them .
 
 
 Right .
 Cool .
 
 There's too much gear . 
 You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss .
Ok oh we do we do . Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway .
 
 
 Okay .
 I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . Boy , let me tell you . 
 Ach [gap] why not  We might have to get you up again then .
 
 I don't know what mine is . I'm gonna have to think on the spot now .
 Impressionist .
 
 
 Can't draw . 
 
 Is that a whale ? 
 Um .
 Yeah .
 Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head .
Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . Allergic to animal fur , so um fish
was a natural choice .
 Ah .
 Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . They come in and go  eat everything in
sight . 
 
 
  Alright .
 And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting .
 Mm .
 Okay . God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . Um .
 Superb sketch , by the way .
  Tail's a bit big , I think . 
 I was gonna choose a dog as well . But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . M my favourite
animal is my own dog at home .  Um 
 
 Yep .
 That doesn't really look like him , actually .
 He looks more like a pig , actually .
 Ah well .
 I see a dog in there . Yep .
 

B: Do you ? Oh that's very good of you .
 
 Now I see a rooster .
 
 
 
 Uh .
 What kind is it ?
 Um he's a mixture of uh various things . Um and what do I like about him , um 
That's just to suggest that his tail wags . Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased
to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um 
 
 
 uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can  doesn't take up too
much space . Um
 
 and uh  And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , which is
quite amusing , so 
 
 Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?
 It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden
just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .
 
 Hmm .
  It's an after dinner dog then .
 Yeah , so uh 
 Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been
conditioned .
 Yeah , maybe .
 Maybe .  Right , um where did you find this ? Just down here ? Yeah .
 
 
 Okay .
  Um what are we doing next ? Uh um .
 Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um
 so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro ,
um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro .
